		 <strong> June 9 </strong> I come from Mauritius and now a Canadian. I have been in Canada for 4 years. I am bilingual fluent in both English and French. My favorite sport is tennis. I love playing games, reading 
		 manga and watching anime/kdramas. 
		<br>
		<br>
			Through out my studies, I always thought about studying mathematics. However, studying in the University of Toronto had changed my mind. I enrolled as a mathematics and economics students. The prerequisite of completing a program has led me to change to study Computer science. As prerequisite, I had to at least complete 1 credit from the science side. So, I chose to do the introduction to computer science course. After completing this course, I realized which program I am supposed to be in. Now, I am a computer science and economics student.
			<br><br>
			Many people in the program has some sort of experience in programming from high school. The fact that I do not have any prior knowledge before University, make me work harder to fill in the gab that I have from experience programming students. I am always eager to learn something new from people in the program. I always try to get resources as much as possible either from the professor or the students around me.
			<br><br>
			My biggest weakness is that I am very impatient. When I planned to do something, I am always eager to finish it as soon as possible. This can cause an issue when working in a group of people because everybody has their own way of doing thing. For me, it might get a bit upsetting because my work might be delayed or even the project because as we get closer to the end, the deadline will not change it will still be the same.
